# Baseline truth

If you don’t have any cloud account, you cannot use S3, Azure Storage, or GCS. That removes the textbook backends. Fine. You still have options—but some are clearly better than others.

# Option 1: Remote backend via Terraform Cloud / HCP (Best practice)

## This is the cleanest, least drama option.

1. State stored remotely
2. Built-in state locking
3. Versioning, audit trail
4. No cloud account required
5. Works perfectly for regulated orgs with limited infra access

## Why this is the gold standard

1. Zero infra ownership
2. Zero state corruption risk
3. Zero “who overwrote prod” incidents
4. Reality check
5. Free tier exists
6. Paid tiers scale well

Security teams usually approve this faster than DIY nonsense

👉 If leadership wants “safe, compliant, boring” — this is it.

# Option 2: Self-hosted Git (ONLY if you know what you’re doing)

You can store the state file in:

1. GitHub Enterprise
2. GitLab
3. Azure DevOps Repos
4. Bitbucket

But listen carefully 👇
This is not recommended for anything beyond PoC.

## Why it’s risky

1. No native state locking
2. Merge conflicts = corrupted state
3. Secrets can leak if you screw up
4. Concurrent applies will wreck you

## When it’s acceptable

1. Single engineer
2. Serial applies only
3. Encrypted state
4. Strong access controls
5. Short-lived projects

Hard rule
If you do this, you:
1. Encrypt state
2. Restrict repo access
3. Never allow parallel runs

# Option 3: Shared filesystem backend (Old-school, still valid)

If your org has:
NFS
SMB share
On-prem server
Internal NAS

You can store state there.

# Pros

1. Simple
2. Centralized
3. Works without cloud

# Cons

1. Locking depends on filesystem reliability
2. Ops team must maintain uptime
3. Not sexy, but stable
4. This is how infra teams did it before cloud hype. Still works.

# Option 4: Local state (Only for learning / lab)

terraform.tfstate on your laptop.

Use this ONLY when Learning Terraform,Doing demos,Zero collaboration,Never use this in real environments. Ever.

Executive recommendation (no fluff)

If I’m advising your org as a DevOps lead:
Terraform Cloud / HCP → default
Shared on-prem storage → acceptable fallback
Git repo → last resort
Local → training wheels only

Anything else is technical debt waiting to explode.
